      <h1> About me</h1>
      <h2>Hiker | Software Developer | Wildlife Lover</h2>
      <p>It was during my Ecology Masters degree that I first encountered coding - we wrote all of our statistical models in R. I remember the excitement of writing my first model, but it never struck me that I could pursue a career in coding, so instead I pursued a career in the field I studied at university.</p>
      <p>The pandemic has allowed me to re-evaluate my career. I spent time researching my options, and discovered coding bootcamps, and the fire was lit. I eventually took the leap and enrolled for an immersive course and it is the best decision I&apos;ve made.</p>
      <p>I am very excited to carry on learning and developing my skills. I have barely scratched the surface and cannot wait to continue my journey into the ever-changing world of software development as a Junior Developer.</p>
